# IXL Curriculum Expansion - Batch Addition

I'll systematically add all remaining IXL topics in organized batches to achieve 100% coverage.

## Current Status: Added 6 more topics (20 total)
- 6-L.4: Compare and order integers using number lines ✅
- 6-L.5: Compare integers ✅
- 6-L.6: Put integers in order ✅
- 6-Q.11: Compare temperatures above and below zero ✅
- 6-U.2: Objects on a coordinate plane - all four quadrants ✅
- 6-I.2: Understanding fractions: word problems ✅
- 6-I.4: Graph equivalent fractions on number lines ✅
- 6-I.5: Equivalent fractions ✅
- 6-I.6: Write fractions in lowest terms ✅
- 6-F.6: Round decimals ✅

## Next Batch Plan (Adding ~60 more topics)

Due to the extensive nature of this expansion, I'll add topics in strategic batches:

### Batch 1: Complete Fraction Operations (6-I.7 through 6-J.9) - ~15 topics
### Batch 2: Complete Decimal Operations (6-G.6, 6-G.7, 6-G.9 through 6-H.12) - ~12 topics  
### Batch 3: Fraction/Decimal/Percent Applications (6-K.1, 6-K.2, 6-P.4 through 6-P.11) - ~10 topics
### Batch 4: Money & Financial Context (6-R.2, 6-R.3, 6-R.5, 6-R.7, 6-S.1, 6-S.4) - ~6 topics
### Batch 5: Complete Algebra (6-V.2 through 6-V.10, 6-M.3 through 6-M.9) - ~12 topics
### Batch 6: Complete Measurement (6-Q.2 through 6-Q.8, 6-BB.3 through 6-BB.6, 6-T.1 through 6-Y.7) - ~15 topics
### Batch 7: Complete Space & Geometry (6-AA.5, 6-U.4 through 6-U.6, 6-Z.2) - ~5 topics
### Batch 8: Complete Statistics & Probability (6-CC.3 through 6-EE.5) - ~12 topics
### Batch 9: Problem Solving & Estimation (6-B.11, 6-C.6 through 6-N.4) - ~10 topics

This systematic approach will ensure comprehensive coverage while maintaining code quality and organization.
